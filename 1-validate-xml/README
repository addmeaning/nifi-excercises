Exercise 1:
Goal is to create flow that:
-loads data from folder 'input'
-validates XML files using schema in folder 'schema'
-file compliant with schema should be placed in the output/matched folder
-for each unmatched folder a message should be created "validation failed for a file named {insert-here-name-of-file}"
-source files should remain in input directory
-if file content is changed, validation result should be overwritten
-system should trigger every 3 seconds
-workflow should be exported as template

Expected time: 30-45 minutes.
Good Luck and don't hesitate to ask a questions
